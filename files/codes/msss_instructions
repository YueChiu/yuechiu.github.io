If you want to apply MSSS matrix computations to your research, please feel free to play with it. 

If you apply the MSSS global preconditioner for PDE-constrained optimization problems or other types of problems, please cite the following paper

@article{Qiu2015a,
        author   = "Qiu, Yue and van Gijzen, Martin B. and van Wingerden, Jan-Willem and Verhaegen, Michel and Vuik, Cornelis",
        title    = {Efficient Preconditioners for {PDE}-Constrained Optimization Problems with a Multilevel Sequentially SemiSeparable Matrix Structure},
        year     = {2015},
        Journal  = {Electronic Transactions on Numerical Analysis},
        note     = {Available at {\textcolor{magenta}{\tt http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/nw/users/yueqiu/publications.html}}}
}

If you apply such methods to solve CFD problems, please cite the following paper,
