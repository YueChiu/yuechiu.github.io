This code is the test code of the Stokes problem of the lid-driven cavity type for the following technical report

To reproduce the results for the test example, the MSSS computations libraries should also be added to the working path. The computational libraries can be fould in the following link

http://ta.twi.tudelft.nl/nw/users/yueqiu/software.html

global_stokes_test.m is the main file for the solution of discrete Stokes problem by using the global MSSS preconditioner

block_stokes_test.m is the main file for the solution of discrete Stokes problem by using the block MSSS preconditioner

If you also want to test the performance of AMG or GMG method for such problems, you should also include IFISS in your working path. IFISS is available via the following website

http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~djs/ifiss/

You can run such test examples for the Stokes flow directly from IFISS to test the performance of the block preconditioneers by the AMG and GMG method to compare with the global MSSS preconditioner

If you would like to apply such computation techniques for solving similar problems by using the MSSS matrix computation libraries, please cite the technical report as following:
